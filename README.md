# CUED Part IA Flood Warning System

This is the Part IA Lent Term computing activity at the Department of
Engineering, University of Cambridge.

Here are the files for the Flood Warning System. The system is divided into several tasks, each of which analyse real time water level data from monitoring stations across the UK. The final tasks culminate in providing feedback on and risk assessment of current and historical levels. I also extended the program by prompting a visual message whenever the flood warning system detects a high risk of flooding.

The activity is documented at
